# Practicum 1 - Question Answering Project
* There are two components in this project, 

**Question Generation:** 
*Given a document (for example the text of a document from Wikipedia), the module should generate a set of questions relevant to that document. The goal is to generate questions that are fluent and reasonable.* 

**Answer Generation :** 
*Given a plain text document and a set of questions, the module should return an answer for each question. The goal is to produce answers that are fluent, correct and concise.*
